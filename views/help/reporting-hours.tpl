	Reporting volunteer hours on InspireVive is easy to do and extremely gratifying once your contributions are approved! Please make sure before reporting volunteer hours to do these things:
	<ul>
		<li>1. <a href="/signup">Create an account</a></li>
		<li>2. Complete the InspireVive Volunteer Application</li>
		<li>3. Become a volunteer of a school or organization on InspireVive</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>1. Login to InspireVive</h4>

<h4>2. Find your school or organization in your profile</h4>

<p>

</p>
<br/>

<h4>3. Select the place or event where you volunteered</h4>

<p>
	All volunteer hours must happen somewhere, whether it at an event or volunteer place for your school or organization or at an <a href="/charities">official InspireVive partner charity</a>. For this step select the volunteer place or event where you performed your hours from the dropdown and click <strong>Go</strong>.

</p>

<h4>3a. Add a volunteer place (optional)</h4>

<p>
	If you volunteered somewhere not on the list, then you can add it! All you need is the name and address of the place you volunteered and contact information for the volunteer coordinator there. You will immediately be able to report hours at places you add, however, the volunteer coordinator at your school or organization will first have to approve the place you added.
</p>
<p>
	Once the place has been approved, InspireVive will e-mail the volunteer coordinator at the place instead of your school or organization to verify your future hours.
</p>
<br/>

<h4>4. Enter the details of your volunteer activity</h4>
<p>
	Finally, you can input the details of your volunteer activity: what day it happened, any relavent tags, and the total number of hours. InspireVive keeps track of hours with the granularity of one day. This means that volunteer hours on the same day will be a single record and volunteer hours across multiple days will be separate records for each day. For simplicity InspireVive does not keep track of fractional volunteer hours, which means any decimals will be rounded down.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
	Volunteer hour entries cannot be more than 12 hours. If volunteering happened over multiple days, please create a separate entry for each day.
</p>

<h4>5. Wait for approval</h4>

<p>
	Once your volunteer hours have been reported, we will contact the appropriate volunteer coordinator for approval. After they approve your hours you will receive an e-mail from InspireVive. Congratulations!
