Dear {$coordinator_name},

We are writing on behalf of {$orgname} to kindly request your help in verifying the volunteer hours {$volunteer_name} claimed occured at {$place_name}. Do you verify that this is correct?

Volunteer: {$volunteer_name}
Place: {$place_name}
Day: {$day}
Number of Hours: {$hours} {$app.locale->p($hours,'hour','hours')}

Yes, this is correct: paste {$approval_link} into your web browser

No, this is not correct: paste {$reject_link} into your web browser

If the reported entry is not correct, once you click "No" we will remove the entry from our database and inform the volunteer that the hours were not verified. If they made a mistake when reporting the hours, they will have the opportunity to report the corrected hours and we will ask for your approval again.

Thank you,
InspireVive
