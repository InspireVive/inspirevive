		<h4>What is InspireVive for Organizations?</h4>
		<p>
			<strong>InspireVive for Organizations</strong> is an online platform to track volunteer activity designed for charities, schools, clubs, and other non-profits. Volunteers are able to report volunteer hours, find upcoming volunteer opportunities, and browse their volunteer history.
		</p>
		<br/>

		<h4>What is the Volunteer Hub?</h4>
		<p>
			The Volunteer Hub is a custom community page available for each charity/non-profit using <strong>InspireVive for Organizations</strong>. On this page the organization may plan events, showcase top volunteers, present organization-wide volunteer statistics, and maintain a continuous stream of the latest volunteer activity within the organization. The Volunteer Hub is only visible to active volunteers within the organization.
		</p>
		<br/>

		<h4>How are volunteer hours reported?</h4>
		<p>
			Volunteer hours can be reported by a volunteer coordinator through <strong>InspireVive for Organizations</strong> or self-reported by volunteers on InspireVive via the Report Hours form.
		</p>

		<p>
			Volunteer hours are reported in 3 simple steps by volunteers:
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Step 1</strong><br/>
			Choose:
			<ul>
				<li>InspireVive Charity</li>
				<li>Organization currently a "volunteer" at</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Step 2</strong><br/>
			If organization chosen in step 1, choose:
			<ul>
				<li>Place</li>
				<li>Event</li>
				<li>New external place (with the volunteer coordinatorâ€™s contact information)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			If charity chosen in step 1, choose:
			<ul>
				<li>Place</li>
				<li>Event</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Step 3</strong><br/>
			Input hours, day performed, and any tags.
		</p>
		<br/>

		<h4>Which volunteer hours can be applied to contests?</h4>
		<p>
			Only approved volunteer hours performed at charities marked as official partners can be applied to contests.
		</p>
		<br/>

		<h4>What are external volunteer places?</h4>
		<p>
			External volunteer places are a feature only available to those using <strong>InspireVive for Organizations</strong>. External places allow an organization to outsource the approval of volunteer hours reported at a specific location to another volunteer coordinator.
		</p>
		<br/>

		<h4>What volunteer activity can volunteer organizations that I "volunteer" at see?</h4>
		<p>
			It depends on the type of the volunteer organization. Organizations may elect to see only volunteer activity performed at the organization (useful for charities), volunteer activity performed at the organization and charities (useful for clubs), or volunteer activity performed anywhere, all volunteer activity (useful for schools).
		</p>
		<p>
			The visibility level of volunteer activity required by each organization you "volunteer" at is shown in the user profile. You maintain the right to revoke access to your volunteer activity at any time.
